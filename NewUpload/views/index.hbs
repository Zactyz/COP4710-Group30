        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>An Exhibition center in the city hosts various events throughout the year, at multiple locations. These
            events are of different types: social, fundraising, tech talks, arts and craft etc. At the moment, each person
            who wishes to attend an event has to create a unique login on every different event host’s website, in
            order to add each event to his/her calendar. The Exhibition center’s management wants a website that
            would present all the different events on its own main website, which would facilitate different event
            managers/hosts to present their details on it, and event attendees to sign-up for these events.
